## Data Imbalance Analysis

- **Gender Imbalance**:
  - Men: 22146 (49.8%)
  - Women: 16553 (37.3%)
  - Unisex: 2418 (5.4%)
  - Boys: 2558 (5.8%)
  - Girls: 1735 (3.9%)
  - **Insight**: Men and Women dominate (\~87% of data), while Unisex, Boys, and Girls are underrepresented, potentially leading to biased model predictions for minority classes.
- **Color Imbalance**:
  - Top 10 colors (Black, Blue, White, Grey, Red, Green, Navy Blue, Brown, Pink, Purple) cover \~82% of the data (36344 items).
  - Remaining 36 colors cover only \~18% (8066 items).
  - **Insight**: The skewed distribution toward top colors suggests grouping into color families (e.g., Neutral: Black/White/Grey, Blue: Blue/Navy Blue) to reduce complexity and handle real-world color variations.
- **Season Imbalance**:
  - Summer: 21476 (48.3%)
  - Fall: 14479 (32.6%)
  - Winter: 6808 (15.3%)
  - Spring: 1647 (3.7%)
  - **Insight**: Summer and Fall dominate (\~81%), while Spring is severely underrepresented, which may affect seasonal trend predictions.
- **Article Type Imbalance**:
  - Top type (Tshirts: 7069) vs. rare types (some with &lt;20 items).
  - **Insight**: The 143 article types create high model complexity, with dominant types like Tshirts and Shirts skewing predictions.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Class Weights**: Apply inverse frequency weights in the loss function to prioritize minority classes (e.g., Girls, Spring).
- **Oversampling**: Oversampling for minority classes like Girls and Spring.
- **Color Families**: Group 46 colors into color-families.
- **Article Type Classification**: Use masterCategory Or subCategory in place of Article Type to reduce model complexity.
- **Augmentation**: Apply image augmentation for minority classes to increase diversity.

## Conclusion


The EDA on the cleaned dataset with 44410 records reveals a skewed gender distribution, with Men (22146, 49.8%) and Women (16553, 37.3%) dominating (~87%), while Unisex (5.4%), Boys (5.8%), and Girls (3.9%) are underrepresented. Summer (21476, 48.3%) and Fall (14479, 32.6%) are key seasons, with Spring (1647, 3.7%) severely underrepresented. T-shirts (7069) and Shirts are top article types among 143, and Black (9728), Blue, and White dominate among 46 colors, with top 10 colors covering ~82% of the data. The high number of article types and colors, combined with imbalances, suggests grouping colors into families (e.g., Neutral, Blue) and using masterCategory/subCategory for hierarchical classification. Class weights, oversampling, and augmentation are recommended to address imbalances and improve model performance.
